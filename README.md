## Main R files

##### analysis_wealth.R: This calculates and maps the relative index of inequality and slope index of inequality at the cluster level.
##### analysis_wealth_reg.R: This calculates and maps the relative index of inequality and slope index of inequality at the regional/province level.
##### analysis_wealth_national.R: This calculates and maps the relative index of inequality and slope index of inequality at the national level.
##### globalG.R: Assessed the global G* statistic before the hotspot/coldspot spatial analysis.
##### hivtest_ineq_fun_2.R: Function needed in analysis_wealth.R to calculate the RII and SII at the national and province level.
##### hivtest_ineq_linear_clust_fun.R: Function needed in analysis_wealth.R to calculate the RII and SII at the cluster level.
##### spatialanalysis2. R: This conducts spatial analysis of inequalities at the cluster level using the Getis-Ord G* statistics.
##### ggscatter_hivprev_test.R: This plots the scatter plot between HIV prevalence and HIV testing at the national, province and cluster level.
##### plot_reg_hivprev_hivtest.R: Maps the HIV prevalence and HIV testing at the province level for all countries and sexes.
##### plots_reg_sii_rii.R: Maps the SII and RII at the province level for all countries and sexes.
##### suppl_distribution.R: Plots the sample size and % of HIV testing distribution at the cluster level.
